 <h4> 2.Find if the conditions are obeyed or not? <br>
You are given two number first as 
A
 and second as 
B
 and check if both conditions (
A
<
10
 and 
A
>
B
) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.

Note: You have to complete Is_Valid function. No need to take any input. </h4>

        You are given two numbers 
        A
         and 
        B
        . You need to do the following checks:
        
        if both are divisible by 10 console true.
        if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
        if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.
        Use operator to do this.
